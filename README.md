## About me:

I am Catalin Chiprian, a 22-year-old student from the Republic of Moldova who is currently living in Hengelo, Netherlands. I am passionate about coding, programming, and anything related to problem solving. I have been actively involved in various coding projects and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

## Educational background:

I obtained my high school diploma in mathematics and informatics in Iasi, Romania, and graduated with a European baccalaureate with an average grade of 8.63. I am currently in the process of obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science at Saxion, and then I plan to pursue a Master's degree at the University of Twente. I have also followed certified coursers that you can see on my LinkedIn page.

## Professional background:

I am employed since June 2024 by AutoForm as an Software Engineer working part-time during my studies. During my studies, I also worked on many projects and published some that I consider worthy of publication. These projects have allowed me to gain practical knowledge and apply theoretical concepts in a real-world setting. You can check the project on my github page.
