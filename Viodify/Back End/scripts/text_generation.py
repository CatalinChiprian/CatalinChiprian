    "Use the example JSON as a guide: " + json.dumps(example_json, indent=4) + " "
    "1. Reconstruct the full spoken text by concatenating all characters. "
    "2. Split the text into words using whitespace. For each word, determine its start time as the start time of its first character and its end time as the end time of its last character. "
    "3. Identify natural segmentation points in the audio, such as sentence boundaries (periods, exclamation points, question marks) or significant pauses. "
    "4. For each identified segment, decide whether an image is necessary. Only generate an image prompt if the segment emphasizes a key point or would benefit from a visual representation. "
    "   It is acceptable to leave some segments without any image if the content is more narrative or doesnâ€™t require visual reinforcement. "
    "   However, if you do think an image is needed, then keep the image at least 3 seconds long. "
    "5. When generating an image prompt, use engaging and relevant keywords that closely describe the audio content of that segment. "
    "6. Create arrays for the image prompts ('images'), the corresponding start times ('image_start_times_seconds'), and the corresponding end times ('image_end_times_seconds'). "
    "You must make sure to have the start and end times match the audio timings accurately."
    "7. Return the output as a JSON object with a single key 'images' containing these arrays. "
    "Include only the necessary text for the JSON output, nothing else. "
    "Remember: images are only needed when they emphasize or enhance the spoken content; do not force images for every segment."
    "Images are not needed for the outro, when users are asked to like, share, and follow."
